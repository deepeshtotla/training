        <p style="margin-top: 250px;color: rgb(245, 239, 240);">Jaipur is the capital of India’s Rajasthan state. It evokes the royal family that once ruled the region and that, in 1727, founded what is now called the Old City, or “Pink City” for its trademark building color.</p>

        <div style="background-color: rgb(161, 232, 161);margin-left: 1%;margin-right: 1%;">Founded in AD 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan is popularly known as the Pink City. With broad avenues and spacious gardens, the city is steeped in history and culture. Here the past comes alive in magnificent forts and palaces, blushed pink, where once lived the maharajas. The bustling bazaars of Jaipur, famous for Rajasthan jewellery, fabric and shoes, possess a timeless quality and are a treasure-trove for the shoppers. 
            Planned by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, Jaipur holds the distinction of being the first planned city of India. Renowned globally for its coloured gems, the capital city of Rajasthan combines the allure of its ancient history with all the advantages of a metropolis. Jaipur rises up majestically against the backdrop of the forts Nahargarh, Jaigarh and Garh Ganesh Temple. The bustling modern city is one of the three corners of the golden triangle that includes Delhi, Agra and Jaipur.
            The story goes that in 1876, the Prince of Wales visited India on a tour. Since the colour pink was symbolic of hospitality, Maharaja Ram Singh of Jaipur painted the entire city pink. The pink that colours the city makes for a marvellous spectacle to behold.</div>

It is situated in the east-central part of the state, roughly equidistant from Alwar (northeast) and Ajmer (southwest). It is Rajasthan’s most-populous city.
            A walled town surrounded (except to the south) by hills, the city was founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh to replace nearby Amber (now Amer, a part of Jaipur) as the capital of the princely state of Jaipur. </div>

Industries include engineering and metalworking, hand-loom weaving, distilling, and the manufacture of glass, hosiery, carpets, blankets, shoes, and drugs. Jaipur’s famous arts and crafts include the making of jewelry, enamel, metalwork, and printed cloths, as well as stone, marble, and ivory carving.</div>
        <div style="float: left;width: 33%;background-color: rgb(186, 161, 232);">The city is surrounded by fertile alluvial plains to the east and south and hill chains and desert areas to the north and west. Bajra (pearl millet), barley, gram (chickpeas), pulses, and cotton are the chief crops grown in the region. Iron ore, beryllium, mica, feldspar, marble, copper, and garnet deposits are worked.
