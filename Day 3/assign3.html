        <div style="background-color: rgb(161, 232, 161);">Founded in AD 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan is popularly known as the Pink City. With broad avenues and spacious gardens, the city is steeped in history and culture. Here the past comes alive in magnificent forts and palaces, blushed pink, where once lived the maharajas. The bustling bazaars of Jaipur, famous for Rajasthan jewellery, fabric and shoes, possess a timeless quality and are a treasure-trove for the shoppers. 
            Planned by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, Jaipur holds the distinction of being the first planned city of India. Renowned globally for its coloured gems, the capital city of Rajasthan combines the allure of its ancient history with all the advantages of a metropolis. Jaipur rises up majestically against the backdrop of the forts Nahargarh, Jaigarh and Garh Ganesh Temple. The bustling modern city is one of the three corners of the golden triangle that includes Delhi, Agra and Jaipur.
            The story goes that in 1876, the Prince of Wales visited India on a tour. Since the colour pink was symbolic of hospitality, Maharaja Ram Singh of Jaipur painted the entire city pink. The pink that colours the city makes for a marvellous spectacle to behold.</div>

It is situated in the east-central part of the state, roughly equidistant from Alwar (northeast) and Ajmer (southwest). It is Rajasthan’s most-populous city.
            A walled town surrounded (except to the south) by hills, the city was founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh to replace nearby Amber (now Amer, a part of Jaipur) as the capital of the princely state of Jaipur (founded by the Rajputs in the 12th century CE). Jaipur grew dramatically in size in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, doubling its population between 1991 and 2011. It has a mixed Hindu-Muslim population. The city was the site of numerous bombing attacks in the early 21st century, with mosques and Hindu temples being targets.        </div>
